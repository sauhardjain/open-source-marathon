# New Features for the Search Engine, Butler.

Backend Feature: Raw Data conversion for Privacy Standards compliance.
<br>
A very disconcerting issue regarding search data storage, which has come up after the implementation of the GDPR is that Search Engines cannot store user data without the user's consent. So a basic solution to that would be adding an automated feature which converts the user's search history into raw data (which can only be used for ranking search results in the future) after 6 months. This would be in compliance with the GDPR and also would solve the issue of ranking search results.
